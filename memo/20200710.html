        <h1>When a Common Fractional Mistake Holds (It doesn't)</h1>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            There's commonly misunderstood calculation of fraction which is
            \[
                \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a+c}{b+d}
            \]
            Of course the correct one is 
            \[
                \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad+bc}{bd}
            \]
            But I wanted to see if the wrong one can be actually valid.
            So in this article, we'll discuss about the validity of the misunderstood fractional calculation.
        </p>
        <h3>Problem I</h3>
        <p>
            <div style="border: solid 1px black; border-radius: 5px; padding-left: 15px;">
                Find sets of $a, b, c, d \in {\rm I\!N} $ which satisfy the following relation
                $$ \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a+c}{b+d} $$
            </div>
            <br>
            Let us first assume that there's sets which satisfy the equation.
            If we solve the equation for a parameter, say \( b \), the equation reduces to
            \[
            \begin{aligned}
                \frac{ad+cb}{bd} &= \frac{a+c}{b+d} \\
                (ad+cb)(b+d) &= (a+c)bd \\
                ad^2 + cb^2 &= 0 \\
                b^2 &= - \frac{a}{c} d^2
            \end{aligned}
            \]
            Therefore, the variable \(b \) can take the two values,
            \[
                b = \pm i \sqrt{\frac{a}{c}} d
            \]
            which contradicts our first assumption since the right hand side always gives imaginary value while the left hand side has to be real.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion I</h3>
        <p>
            As long as we consider in \({\rm I\!N}\) space, there's no solutions for 
            $$ \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a+c}{b+d} $$
            to be hold.
            <br>
            However, if we consider the case which variables are in \({\rm I\!R}\) space, there exist solutions for
            \[
                b = \pm i \sqrt{\frac{a}{c}} d
            \]
            The left hand side is again, a real number.
            The right hand side has an imaginary unit, however, the square root part can also give an imaginary unit since \(a\) and \(c\) are in \({\rm I\!R}\).
        </p>
        <p>
            If we would consider parameters in \({\rm I\!R}\) space, the following relation must hold as stated above.
            \[
                \frac{a}{c} \leq 0
            \]
            Be careful since we don't know if $c$ is positive or not, we cannot simply eliminate $c$ by multiplying it on both sides.
            <br>
            However, for simplicity, we take $c$ to be negative. We redefine the parameter $c$ to be $c \to -c$.
            Thus the prescribed relations become
            \[
                \begin{aligned}
                    \frac{a}{b} &- \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a-c}{b+d} && (0 \leq a, 0 < c) \\
                    b &= \mp \sqrt{\frac{a}{c}} d
                \end{aligned}
            \]
            This is against our intuition because the denominator part of the fraction is $b + d$, not $b - d$.
            What we want to know is "Is there any case that commonly mistaken fractional calculation holds?"
            So this issue is not worth discussing and we'll just move forward.
        </p>
        <h3>Problem II</h3>
        <p>
            <div style="border: solid 1px black; border-radius: 5px; padding-left: 15px;">
                Find sets of $a, b, c, d \in {\rm I\!N} $ which satisfy the following relation
                $$ \frac{a}{b} - \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a-c}{b-d} $$
            </div>
            We now seek for clues where 
            \[
                \begin{aligned}
                    \frac{a}{b} - \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a-c}{b-d} && (a, b, c, d \in \N)
                \end{aligned}
            \]
            to be hold. Again with the same procedure, we get the following relation
            \[
                b = d \left( 1 \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{a}{c}} \right) \\
                0 < \frac{a}{c} \leq 1
            \]
            The second line follows from the fact that $d$ cannot be imaginary and $a/c$ is always positive.
            The square root can be expressed by another natural number $x$.
            \[
                \begin{aligned}
                1 - \frac{a}{c} = x^2 && (x \in \N)
                \end{aligned}
            \]
            Notice that since
            \[
                1 > 1 - \frac{a}{c} = x^2 \geq 0
            \]
            $x$ only can take a value: $x = 0$. That's equivalent to the situation where $b = d$.
            But when $b=d$, the denominator of the fraction limits to zero which means calculation diverges.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusion II</h3>
        <p>
            There's no way for
            \[
                \frac{a}{b} - \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a-c}{b-d}
            \]
            to be hold.
            Together with the previous result that there's no solution for 
            \[
                \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a+c}{b+d}
            \]
            So what we can conclude here is
            <strong>"Commonly misunderstood calculation of fraction is always invalid."</strong>
