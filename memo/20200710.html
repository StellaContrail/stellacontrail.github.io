        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <div style="border: solid 1px black; border-radius: 5px; padding-left: 15px;">
            Find sets of \(a, b, c, d \in {\rm I\!N} \) which satisfy the following relation
            $$ \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a+c}{b+d} $$
        </div>
        <br>
        Let us first assume that there's any set which satisfies the equation.
        If we solve the equation for a parameter, say \( b \), the equation reduces to
        \begin{eqnarray}
            \frac{ad+cb}{bd} &=& \frac{a+c}{b+d} \\
            (ad+cb)(b+d) &=& (a+c)bd \\
            ad^2 + cb^2 &=& 0 \\
            b^2 &=& - \frac{a}{c} d^2
        \end{eqnarray}
        Therefore, the variable \(b \) can take the two values,
        \begin{equation}
            b = \pm i \sqrt{\frac{a}{c}} d
        \end{equation}
        which contradicts our first assumption since the right hand side always gives imaginary value while the left hand side has to be real.
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        As long as we consider in \({\rm I\!N}\) space, there's no solutions for 
        $$ \frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a+c}{b+d} $$
        to be hold.
        <br>
        However, if we consider the case which variables are in \({\rm I\!R}\) space, there exist solutions for
        \begin{equation}
            b = \pm i \sqrt{\frac{a}{c}} d
        \end{equation}
        The left hand side is again, a real number.
        The right hand side has an imaginary unit, however, the square root part can also give an imaginary unit since \(a\) and \(c\) are in \({\rm I\!R}\).
